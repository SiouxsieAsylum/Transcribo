## Env Problems that need solving: 
- Using Node 18+ causes `digital envelope routines::unsupported` error
    - "worked around" by:
        - running `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` <----  works for now
        - downgrading NODE
- Using Webpack 5 is causing issues for version of React-Scripts, which requires webpack 4
    - deleting package.json and reinstalling does not work
    - created .env and added `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` to it
    - will likely need to downgrade webpack
- No script for installing and running both sets of packages, or killing both servers, or refreshing both servers.

## Functionality problems that need solving
- `Reached transcription time limit, press Ctrl+C`
- ~~Many transcripts come through, only need one and the most faithful one~~ **Handled by removing React.StrictMode**
- ~~Websocket keeps collapsing and reestablishing~~ **Solved by memoizing the websocket component**

## Next Steps in development
### Server
- Taking commands
- Speech diarization
- User auth and session info
- MongoDB hookup
    - save results and sent transcript 
    - save user session info
- Different services
    - AWS
    - Open AI
    - ???
    - Configurability btwn all of them
- Set up a script to restart browser when api updates
- Set up docker container to make installation easy
- Secrets management

### Client
- Flow chart
    - Lines
    - Forks
    - Box
- Timeline
- Chosen Path
- User Auth


## Documentation that needs doing
- Actual detailed install instructions

## Random refactors
- camelcase the configs
