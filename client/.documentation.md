## Env Problems that need solving: 
- Using Node 18+ causes `digital envelope routines::unsupported` error
    - "worked around" by:
        - running `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` <----  works for now
        - downgrading NODE
- Using Webpack 5 is causing issues for version of React-Scripts, which requires webpack 4
    - deleting package.json and reinstalling does not work
    - created .env and added `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` to it
    - will likely need to downgrade webpack
- No script for installing and running both sets of packages, or killing both servers, or refreshing both servers.
